<h1>PLP Python Hackathon</h1>
<p>We formed a <a href = "https://replit.com/team/Group-31">replit team</a> where we all contributed the various tasks and held various zoom meetings to discuss the problem statements.</p>
<p>Our work is divided into folders containing the different days tasks(problem statements) and their problem definitions (a short explanation explaining how we solved the various problems) </p>
