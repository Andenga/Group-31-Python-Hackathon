<h1>Door lock system Challenge – Task One (Day 3)<h1>
  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>Write a python program that simulates a door lock system such that:<br>
<ul>
<li>Password is set and stored in a variable</li>
<li>Commands to instruct the door are stored in variables.</li>
<li>When a user enters the wrong password an error message is displayed and prompted to enter the password again.</li>
<li>When a user enters “open” a “The door is now open” statement is displayed, when the “open” is entered more that once, a message is displayed saying, “the door is already open”</li>
<li>When a user enters “close” a “The door is now locked” statement is displayed, when the “open” is entered more that once, a message is displayed saying, “the door is already locked”</li>
<li>When a user enters “quit” the process is terminated and message is displayed.</li>
<li>When a wrong message is entered or invalid key pressed a “Invalid input” message is displayed.</li>
<li>When the door is locked or open, it prints out the last date/time the door was opened, eg “Door Last open  at 2022-07-05 08:46:20.535395”</li>

  <h1>Day 3: Challenge Task Two (Day 3))<h1>
  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
   
<p>Calories from Fat and Carbohydrates A nutritionist who works for a fitness club helps members by evaluating their diets. As part of her evaluation, she asks members for the number of fat grams and carbohydrate grams that they consumed in a day. Then, she calculates the number of calories that result from the fat, using the following formula:<br>
  <ul>
<li>Calories from fats fat grams * 9</li>
    </ul>
Next, she calculates the number of calories that result from the carbohydrates, using the following formula:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Calories from carbs carb grams * 4</li>
</ul>
The nutritionist asks you to write a program that will make these calculation.
